## Title: Sports Pose Tracking and Visualization

### A. Project Overview:
This project utilizes the Mediapipe library for real-time sports pose tracking and visualization in videos. The main objective is to leverage pose estimation to identify and track key body landmarks in sports footage.

### B. Motivation
Understanding sports movements and poses has various applications, including sports analysis, training feedback, and biomechanics research. This project showcases the capabilities of the Mediapipe library in tracking and visualizing sports poses in real-time.

### C. Project Structure:
The project is organized into the following components:

#### 1] Pose Estimation:
* Utilizes the Mediapipe library to estimate and track key body landmarks in each frame of the sports video.
* Landmarks are used to create a pose skeleton, providing visual insights into the athlete's movements.

#### 2] Video Processing:
* Reads a sports video file frame by frame using OpenCV.
* Applies pose estimation on each frame and renders the detected landmarks.

#### 3] Visualization:
* Draws pose landmarks on each frame using Mediapipe's drawing utilities.
* Customizable drawing specifications, such as color, thickness, and circle radius, enhance the visualization.


## Adjusting Video Dimensions
-- The project allows customization of the output video dimensions to suit specific requirements. Modify the desired_width and desired_height variables to achieve the desired video size.


## Results:
* The resulting video showcases sports poses with annotated landmarks in real-time. This project aims to provide valuable insights into athlete movements during sports activities.
